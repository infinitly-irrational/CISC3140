#Description
This assignment involes using the scheme programming language and solving problems. I decided to do the temperature conversion from fahrenheit to celcius and vice versa. I defined two functions, each having one parameter. Scheme uses prefix notation to for evaluation. It probably did not matter but for this assignment I referenced a guide that is based on R5RS.

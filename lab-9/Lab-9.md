I chose Khan academy as my resource. I’ve used Khan academy many times in the past and I’ve always liked their explanations and exercises after videos. In the videos, I learned what SQL is and why it’s used. I also learned how to use it by doing the exercises. I got to learn how to create a table, inserting new records, requesting data from a table such as a certain column, and I also learned how to add ‘parameters’ when querying the table. Regarding querying the table, there are many ways to do it when specifying parameters. We can use words like “where”, “AND”, “OR”, or “IN”, with each word having a different use case. We can use AND to make sure more than 1 parameter is fulfilled when querying and use OR when we want either of the parameters fulfilled. Another keyword I learned was HAVING. It has a similar function to WHERE except that WHERE cannot be used with aggregate functions. Another SQL command I learned that I thought was helpful is CASE. This command works the same way as an If-statement or Switch statement in programming. The last concept I learned about were the different types of joins and how they each differ. All in all, I liked this lab. I managed to complete a total of 3 sections, and am hoping to do more in the future, probably completing the entire Khan academy course. This lab was definitely very useful in getting a start with SQL as it was something I had been putting off for a while.

I had a very very very hard time getting SVN to work on MacOS compared to Git. It was also hard to understand how to navigate it. Git had many more succinct videos/guides compared to SVN and I had 0 trouble. SVN had videos 10+ years old that made it hard to follow certain steps due to changes to SVN and the official textbook guide was only a bit useful (too much info to navigate and not enough time to read through the sections). Also every guide that I saw used a windows GUI for SVN and I was looking for terminal only guide. I attempted to download a MacOS SVN client but it was even more confusing. I ended up figuring out how to get it to work, although I'm not sure if I did it correctly. 

For each task I attempted to understand each task and break it down to smaller tasks (if required) just like we do with programming. Becoming more familiar with the terminal prior to this task greatly helped as I didn't have to lookup basic commands for the things I needed such as 'pwd', 'cd', 'ls', 'touch', and 'nano'.

I overall liked Git way more than Subversion due to finding more extensive and succinct documentation to learn. Information was easier to find, and based on the differences between centralized and decentralized VCS, I will be drawn more to use decentralized VCS in the future. I hope my future employer doesn't use Subversion.
